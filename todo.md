8. [ ] Asset Path 
9. [ ] ECS improvement
10. [ ] TileMap improvement depends upon 5
11. [ ] Think about render Asset. 
12. [ ] Add index_buffer and vertex_buffer into Gpu like texture_buffer
13. [ ] `BufferVec<T>` from bevy
14. [ ] Convert rgb to srgb in shader
15. [ ] Figure out why (-x, +y) or (+x, -y) scale is not working
16. [ ] Think about either I need common Vertex class or not
17. [ ] `Struct wgpu_util::DynamicBuffer`: A wgpu::Buffer which dynamically grows based on the contents.
